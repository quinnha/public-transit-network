# public-transit-network

Given a list of train stations, what's the quickest way to get from station A to station B? This project calculates shortest path using 2 algorithms Dijkstra's and A-Star to determine the best way to get around. Currently implemented on the London Tube Network, with plans to expand to APAC region.
