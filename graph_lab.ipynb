    "#### Diagram\n",
    "![week1](img/week1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation\n",
    "Within object-oriented programming, there are 5 main principles named SOLID. Our goal while\n",
    "modifying the design was to meet the SOLID principles to ensure that the best practices are met when it\n",
    "comes to class structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SOLID principles stand for:\n",
    "- Single responsibility principle\n",
    "- Open-closed principle\n",
    "- Liskov substitution principle\n",
    "- Interface segregation principle\n",
    "- Dependency Inversion principle\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the class diagram above, we have created new class files such as zone.py and island.py. Our newly created files support the single responsibility principle as each class specifically carries one responsibility. Our zone.py carries the responsibility of storing a subset of stations in a graph and island.py carries the responsibility of storing a subset of stations in a zone. Our metric_extractor.py file has an abstract class that carries the abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we have created the file metric_extractor.py to hold abstract classes that our metric_extractor_graph.py can further implement. By following the Factory design pattern, our metrics are open-closed (we can add new metrics without changing other code), and we adhere by the dependency inversion princple (by loosely coupling related classes together through abstraction).\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the interface segregation principle, it implies the idea that a client should not be exposed to\n",
    "methods it does not need. Therefore, with the ccreation of several classes, it has it’s own availability of\n",
    "implementing its own methods and carrying a responsibility that the class wants to proceed with. The\n",
    "open-close principle states that an entity must be open for extension but closed for modification. This\n",
    "practice in object-oriented programming can further reduce future errors as modifications can lead to\n",
    "problems in other categories. Whereas the possibility of extension is a good asset to have in case there\n",
    "are future situations where you may want to create new functionalities in order to advance in the\n",
    "project at hand.\n",

    "#### Performance Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Shortest Path\n",
    "From a theoretical standpoint when comparing the two shortest path algorithms implemented in week 1, it is commonly the case where A* is a lot faster than Dijkstra’s. The explanation of our code implementation of our heuristics and algorithms were given under the benchmarking portion above (Week1-PartC). When it comes to the empirical point of view of this lab, the implementations of our algorithms shows that Dijkstra’s gives a better performance than A. We have run several tests/benchmarking of the algorithm and every test returns an approximate speed difference by approximately 2.5 times. This means that the Dijkstra’s Algorithm is running 2.5 times faster than the A algorithm and with a smaller uncertainty by approximately 2 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Subway Patrol Planning\n",
    "As for the Subway Patrol Planning algorithm, it is very similar to the travelling salesman shortest path algorithm, and it essentially visits all stations and returns to the start station. Our implementation was to visit all necessary stations and then apply Dijkstra’s to go back. The time complexity for this algorithm would be O(s + i<sup>2</sup>pja) where s = stations, i and j = index variables, p = permutations, and a = running time for A. When it comes to the empirical perspective and verifying by observation, the Subway Patrol planning will take approximately 0.03114938735961914 seconds for only 5 stations. The greatest reason as to why the Subway Patrol planning has a very large run time is due to the exponential time complexity of generating permutations.\n",

    "##### Urbanism Planning\n",
    "From a theoretical perspective, the Urbanism Planning algorithm has a run time of O(kz<sup>2</sup>s + kz<sup>2</sup>s<sup>2</sup>*c) where k = key, z = zone, s = station, and c = connection. The run time of this algorithm should be fairly slow because it has two for loops within a for loop, and within one of those for loops, there is a recursive call of the DFS implementation which also carries a run time of connections for every station. When it comes to the empirical perspective and verifying by observation, the urbanism planning takes approximately 0.003573894500732422 seconds for a set of 304 stations\n"

    "So far in my sofware engineering degree, we simply learned about concepts - I felt that this project gave us an opportunity to hone our \"engineering\" skills, by building a system from the ground up. I enjoyed the freedom given to the students to explore different methods of implementation, with little guidance, as I feel as that correctly reflects engineering work tasked in the workforce. Furthermore, the scale of work was enjoyable, as there was many complex intersections between components of the system design which was fun to work through.\n",
    "\n",
    "I disliked the amount of implementation needed for this work given the time allocated. I felt as week 1 could have been the entire project due to how much was expected in the single week - we were thrown in the deep end with this new way of thinking and creating: after all, our entire education is built on following instructions. In addition, it also felt as the TA's were understandably lost in sections of the project while attempting to help us, I wish we had a portion in the instructions which summarized expectations for each part of the project. One part of engineering is being able to communicate with stakeholders, and if the stakeholders (TAs) aren't aligned across section, it becomes difficult to navigate how we can best deliver.\n",

    "#### Outward\n",
    "One thing I'm proud of is how I modified my connection object to fit connections between stations and connections between zones! In addition, being able to use the metric extractor to drill in and get more granular information on a graph or zone level while reusing code was a neat trick that was implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Forward\n",
    "If i had the chance to redo this project, I would implement more design patterns to enforce SOLID principles. For example, I would use a strategy deisgn pattern for our shortest path algorithm should a new one be more appropriate for our situation - with a strategy deisng pattern, it would be open to extension but closed for modification. In addition, I would love to dive deeper into our heuristics in how we determine the shortest path, taking in external factors into account such as number of lines, stations, potential expected closures, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, our method of implementing a list of stations would be revamped, as some stations this time around were missing, and were manually added. Indexing plays a large part of various algorithms in the project, so adapting our code structure to allow for more flexibility would be performed next time!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Thoughts\n",
    "This project was super fun. I really loved the freedom we had to design a solution from scratch - I actually feel like I'm in an engineering program instead of a diluted CS degree. The deliverables first two weeks hit the sweet spot of difficulty when it came to the main implementation, with an increased difficulty with testing, benchmarking, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest complaint I would have is the lack of time - week 1 and the pre-lab could have been the entire lab, especially as some groups weren't resolved until the second week. The timeline felt rushed, with no feedback on weekly activity that would have helped our group iterate over our implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I wish there was more clarity over how to implement testing and benchmarking outside of a couple of lecture slides: I would've been better equipped with some real-time in-class examples of how to implement these aspects, as well as in depth explanation on how each feature works (maybe more lectures are required haha).

We have covered every detail and more regarding the outline of this lab. We have asked several questions when we were ever confused, and we put in our best efforts to create all the required classes, separate them into a sort of library, and overall, be very organized with all our hard work. \n",

    "Assuming that anything can be changed, I would increase the amount of time we were given to complete this lab. With more time available, it gives us access to more creativity and design regarding the aspects of this project. It would also give us more time to better implement the algorithms, if possible, to perform a better run time and time complexity of each algorithm."
